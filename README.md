# Naughts and Crosses
A project to have fun while revising Java. After a while of not using Java, I'd like to re-familiarise myself with it  
while making something I can look back over and improve.  

## The Objective
Naughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe) is a two player game played on a 3 x 3 grid. Each player takes it in turns to place  
their symbol (either an X or O) on to a space on the grid. The first to three in a row (or column or diagonal) wins!  
When the game is played optimally, the players will always draw.  
In this version of the game, the 'computer' is player 2.

## Features
The things I want this programme to do. No use in writing any code if I don't have a good plan first.

- [ ] As a player, so that I can interact with the game, I'd like to see the grid
    - [x] Display grid as an array of arrays
    - [ ] Display grid as it is in the physical game
- [ ] As a player, so that I can interact with the game, I'd like to use the keyboard to make inputs
- [ ] As a player, so that I can see the state of the game, I'd like to see where the Xs and Os have been placed
    - [x] Show values as is so `0`, `1`, and `2` for empty, X and O
    - [ ] Show values as in the physical game, so ` `, `X`, and `O`
- [ ] As a player, so that the game is fun, I'd like the computer to place a symbol on its turn
